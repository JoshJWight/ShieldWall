# ShieldWall
This project was the result of me challenging myself to make something cool over the course of 30 days in October 2019.
I was inspired by watching videos about ancient warfare. Unlike our usual fantasy depictions of heroes deciding a battle with their masterful swordwork, battles were decided by the strength of a battle line or a clever flanking maneuver.
ShieldWall attempts to capture some of those ideas in a battle simulator.
